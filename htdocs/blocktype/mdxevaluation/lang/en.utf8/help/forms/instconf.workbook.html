<h3>Excellent</h3>

<p>Clear evidencing of research, experimentation, quantity of work & self reflection, showing substantially more than the minimum requirements of the brief. The workbook shows clear development both of the idea and personally. Well written, clear, considered proposal that links the concept with the themes of the brief and sets out how the aims will be achieved. Well written critical and reflective evaluation, highlighting areas for improvement and the means to achieve them, and making clear conceptual links between project themes, technical skills and project outcomes. Critical but realistic self evaluation and self grade. High level of literacy, well presented (spelling, grammar, layout). There is clear evidence of learning and the student has highlighted areas that still need work.</p>

<h3>Very Good</h3>

<p>All research, experimentation and work is well documented with self-relfection on the process, showing more than the minimum requirements as set out in the brief, in a clear, well presented manner with a good level of literacy. There is good evidence that ideas have been developed throughout the project and how the research has influenced this. The proposal explains the concept of the project and how it fulfils the brief and connects with the theme of the project, with some indication of how this might be achieved. The self-evaluation shows some critical and reflective evaluation of the project with a realistic self-grade, that highlights areas for improvement.</p>

<h3>Good</h3>

<p>The workbook contains more than the minimum requirements as set out in the brief. There is some evidence of the development of the ideas. The research undertaken is presented clearly with some good references and some self-reflection. Learning, experimentation and technical development is well evidenced with some level of self-reflection on the process. The proposal sets out clear aims for the project and connects the concept to the project theme. The self-evaluation has some good self-reflection with some critical analysis of the project, and highlights some suggested areas of improvement. The self-grade is realistic. All the work undertaken is well documented.The writing shows a good level of literacy.</p>

<h3>Pass</h3>
<p>The workbook contains the minimum requirements as set out in the brief. There is little evidence showing the development of ideas. There is evidence of the research undertaken, but it consists of mainly cut and paste images with little personal reflection. There is some evidence of the learning that has taken place but it lacks self-reflection on the process. Writing shows a basic level of literacy and is mainly clear and well presented. There is a proposal that sets out the basic aims of the project. The self evaluation contains some basic self reflection on the project limited to a descriptive nature rather than a critical nature. The self-grade is on the whole realistic. There is some evidence the student has undertaken some experimentation throughout the project with minimum development of ideas and technical skills. There is sufficient evidence to support the work that has been undertaken.</p>

<h3>Fail</h3>
<p>The workbook contains less than the minimum requirements as set out in the brief. There is little or no evidence of development of ideas. There is little or no evidence of the quantity and quality of research undertaken. There is no clear indication of what if anything the student has learned throughout the project. The writing lacks clarity and shows a low level of literacy and is poorly presented (Spelling grammar, layout). The proposal for the project is either missing or is vague and badly articulated. There is no critical self evaluation of the project and the self-grade is unrealistic based upon the assessment criteria. There is little or no evidence of experimentation, development of ideas or technical development. There is a clear lack of evidence of the quantity of work undertaken (i.e. less than 20 posts in your blog).</p>
